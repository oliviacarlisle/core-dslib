# TypeScript Data Structures
Production-ready robust &amp; efficient implementations of common data structures in TypeScript.

To provide standardized solutions for data structures that do not exist natively in TypeScript, implementations in this repo are inspired by Java's native implementations of corresponding data structures. However, they still follow TypeScript paradigms whenever applicable.
