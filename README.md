# TypeScript Data Structures
Production-ready robust &amp; efficient implementations of common data structures in TypeScript.

To provide standardized solutions for data structures that do not exist natively in TypeScript, these implementations are inspired by Java's native implementations of corresponding data structures. However, for compatibility and ease-of-use, they still follow and prioritize TypeScript paradigms whenever applicable.
